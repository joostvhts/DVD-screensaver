# DVD-screensaver
This bit of code written in Processing will open a fullscreen window that shows the classical dvd-screensaver-like bouncing image that changes colour and image upon hitting an edge of the screen. Originally written for youtuber/streamer AcapellaScience, but swapping the images and updating the integer 'n' allows any other (combination of) image(s)!
