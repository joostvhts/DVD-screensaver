# DVD-screensaver
This bit of code written in Processing will open a fullscreen window that shows the classical dvd-screensaver-like bouncing image that changes colour and image upon hitting an edge of the screen. Originally written for youtuber/streamer AcapellaScience, but swapping the images and updating the integer 'n' allows any other (combination of) image(s)! Feel free to steal this and alter it however you like.

How to use:
1. Install 'processing'.
2. Swap any of the stock images, be sure to name them 'image1.png' through 'imageN.png'
3. Open the .pde file. If you changed the number of images, edit int n accordingly.
4. Choose either of these:
    - Hit play in the top left to run the code on the spot.
    - Export the application from processing and you'll have created a standalone .exe file. Be sure to copy your images to the folder containing the .exe file.
5. Profit.
